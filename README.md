# File-Encryption-and-Decryption
Encryption is a form of data security in which information is converted to ciphertext. Only authorized people who have the key can decipher the code and access the original plaintext information.

Decryption is the process of transforming data that has been rendered unreadable through encryption back to its unencrypted form.
